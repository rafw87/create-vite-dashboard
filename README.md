# React + TypeScript + Vite + Material UI

This template provides basic setup to build dashboard (single page application)
in React and Material UI, written in Typescript and working in Vite.

## Usage

Both command are equivalent.
```shell
$ npx @rafw87/create-vite-dashboard
$ npm create @rafw87/vite-dashboard
```

Optionally, location may be provided:
```shell
$ npx @rafw87/create-vite-dashboard my-dashboard
$ npm create @rafw87/vite-dashboard my-dashboard
```

Script will ask for location (it may be skipped if provided as first argument),
project name (by default guessed from location) and few other `package.json` fields.

Then it will create provided directory, initialize GIT repository, copy files,
perform `npm install` and commit. When finished, repo is ready to further development.
